package auth

func Routes() {
	// This function is intended to register the routes for the auth package.
	// In a real application, you would typically use a router to define your routes here.
	// For example, using Gorilla Mux or Gin, you would do something like:
	//
	// router.HandleFunc("/login", LoginHandler).Methods("POST")
	// router.HandleFunc("/logout", LogoutHandler).Methods("POST")
	//
	// For now, we'll just print a message to indicate that this function has been called.
